			"sessionAbstract": ["Recently, Advanced Persistent Threat (hereinafter APT) attacks using a Drive By Download (hereinafter DBD) method are occurring with increasing frequency. Like Ransomware and Trojans, since malwares using a DBD method mainly have the objective of obtaining pecuniary advantages, they are intended to be massively circulated to unspecified individuals. For such malwares, even though existing auto analysis systems generally come to analyze them, existing auto analysis systems generally are not able to analyze elaborate malwares utilized for APT attacks. For example, in elaborate malwares such as Black Energy used in the Ukraine blackout, Citadel which targeted Japanese financial information, Poweliks which has a Fileless function, and Zero Access which has a Rookit function embedded therein, since there are parts of the malware that existing auto analysis systems cannot solve, a malware researcher has to manually analyze them. The system realized through the present research is a new real time memory auto analysis system (hereinafter Malware Analyst) which overcomes limitations of the parts for which existing auto analysis systems and the existing memory analysis systems cannot solve. As a solution to the limits of the existing systems, this system does not generate a memory dump by utilizing LibVMI, directly accesses a memory to improve diagnostic speed compared to the existing auto analysis systems, and clearly distinguishes behaviors of malware, which is not information for the entire system, from system behaviors. In addition, a Hooking engine and a memory analyzing engine are utilized to divide roles respectively suitable for properties of the engines. As the result of the present research, it is expected that it will be possible to detect a change in process through real-time memory analysis and timeline of a malware to help existing security solutions and analysts analyze malware that is difficult to analyze."],

This is because there is some flexibility in file formats, and different compilers usually produce binaries with identical behaviors but with subtle differences in structure and organization. We developed a tool which can determine the compiler used to create Dalvik executables and Android binary XML files. This allowed us to distinguish between apps compiled from original source code and apps which had been modified using non-standard compilers such as dexlib. Our hypothesis was that the two primary reasons reasons for modifying an Android app were for 1.) cracking and piracy and 2.) injecting malicious code. We tested this assumption by comparing the compiler profiles of various app markets with varying tolerances for cracked and malicious apps to see if the percentage of modified apps was inversely proportional to how strict the store was about policing submissions. We found that strict markets such as Google Play and Amazon had significantly lower rates of modified apps compared to less strict markets such as Aptoide and BlapkMarket. Additionally, we analyzed ~138,000 benign apps and known malware samples to compare the rates of modification between both groups. We found much higher rates of modification within the malware sample set with many malware families consisting entirely of modified apps.", "This talk presents the history and evolution of various Android tools, introduces tools for fingerprinting compilers, summarizes the technical details for how the tools work, and reviews applications for using compiler fingerprinting to improve detection and classification of malware and pirated apps."],

Prevention and rescue are different aspects to solve this problem, and our session will discuss about the way of prevention. We have a preliminary demo on Mac OS X to prove (the encryption type) ransomware behavior and detection model.","The most difficult part for malware detection is the judgement of malware behavior. Take screen-sharing tool as an example, it should be recognized as a malware if it’s installed by hacker, while it’s just a normal tool if it’s a meeting software used by your company. Despite the same behavior of the software, they have totally different intention indeed. And that’s the most perplexing part of malware detection. Fortunately, the behavior of ransomware is relatively simple: no matter doing encryption or not, a ransomware must do some key actions to “kidnap” the files. Our detection model is then based on these key actions to detect ransomware.","Our session will share the detail of these key actions and the detection model. The detection model is independent with platform so it can be implemented on different platforms to detect ransomware everywhere. The speaker will have a demo to catch these key actions on Mac OS X and find the ransomware finally.", "隨著 Bitcoin 的發展，勒索軟體開始各處橫行，欲解決此問題，可從\"防範\"與\"救災\"兩個角度切入。本議程探討的是從\"防範\"的角度切入，探討(加密型)勒索軟體的行為及偵測模型，並在Mac OS X上演示初步的成果。","對於一般的惡意程式而言，最困難的問題便是：什麼是惡意行為？例如螢幕共享軟體，若是駭客偷裝在你電腦裡的，那便是惡意程式；若是你和公司開會用的軟體，那就是個工具軟體。而此軟體的\"行為\"皆同，背後的\"意圖\"卻不同。這是惡意程式偵測中最困擾的難題之一。然而，勒索軟體的行為卻相對單純：要\"綁架\"一個檔案，不論加密與否，都必需經過幾個關鍵動作，本議程所探討的模型即是藉由這些動作來偵測勒索軟體。","本議程要與各位分享這些\"關鍵動作\"為何，以及在其上所發展出來的偵測模型。這個偵測模型與平台無關，只要將其實作在不同平台上，便可偵測該平台的勒索軟體。講者會在Mac OS X上演示透過捕捉這些關鍵動作來成功偵測的例案。"],

Interaction between the multimedia processing module Stagefright and various codecs in Android MediaServer are also based on this standard.

However, few security researchers keep their mind on the layout and implementation of OMX.","We have developed a fuzzing tool for Android OMX and with it we find a series of vulnerabilities. Up until July 2016, Google has publicly confirmed 18 OMX vulneribilities (17 High Severity and 1 Moderate Severity) found by us.

These services raised the bar for reverse-engineering and protected many apps from being pirated. At the same time, we notice that different techniques to unpack the packed apps are proposed and presented in both industrial and academic security conferences. ","In this talk, I will present the evolution of the android app packing and unpacking techniques. I will first review different packing techniques used by app protection services, and ways used to bypass these protections. Based on the review, I will then discuss one limitation of all the previously proposed unpacking methods, i.e., they only focus on the way to dump the app’s dex code from memory (at runtime). Due to this limitation, some new techniques are proposed and adopted. For instance, the app’s dex code is translated into native code and deep-coupled with the packing engine. In this case, even the dex code could be dumped from memory, the code is not complete and is hard to be repackaged (due to the deep-coupled relationship between the app’s dex code and the packing engine). At last, I will take a step further and propose a new general way to tamper with the packed apps."],
